    <h1>Common cuttlefish</h1>
    <p><b>The common cuttlefish or European common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis)</b> is one of the largest and
        best-known cuttlefish
        species. They are a migratory species that spend the summer and spring inshore for spawning and then move to
        depths of
        100 to 200m during autumn and winter.<a href="#"><sup>[2]</sup></a> They grow to 49 cm in mantle length (ML) and 4 kg in weight.<a href="#"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Animals
        from
        subtropical seas are smaller and rarely exceed 30 cm in ML.<a href="#"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

    <p>The common cuttlefish is native to at least the Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, and Baltic Sea, although subspecies
        have
        been proposed as far south as South Africa. It lives on sand and mud seabeds and it can tolerate brackish water
        conditions.<spu>[6]</spu>
    </p>
    <h2>Predators</h2>
    <p>Cuttlefish only have a lifespan of 1â€“2 years (captive and wild) and have many predators including sharks,
        dolphins,
        seals, fish, and cephalopods which includes other cuttlefish.[5] They have many defensive mechanisms to help
        protect
        them from predators including a siphon which they can use to shoot water out of to propel them away from danger,
        ink
        which can distract and disorient a predator as the cuttlefish escapes, and their camouflage abilities which can
        help
        them avoid predators altogether.<sup>[6]</sup></p>

    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>During the day, most cuttlefish can be found buried below the substrate and fairly inactive. At night however,
        they are
        actively searching for prey and can ambush them from under the substrate. Cuttlefish are carnivorous and eat a
        variety
        of organisms including crustaceans (crabs and shrimp), small fish, molluscs (clams and snails), and sometimes
        other
        cuttlefish which is more commonly seen when the abundance of other prey is low.<sup>[5]</sup></p>
    <h2>Anatomy</h2>
    <p>The common cuttlefish is one of the largest species of cuttlefish with their mantles (does not include their head
        and
        arms) reaching upwards of 45 cm. The mantle houses the reproductive and digestive tracts of the cuttlefish and
        is also
        home to an internal shell called the cuttlebone.<sup>[2]</sup> The common cuttlefish has two highly developed
        eyes, eight arms
        which are located around the mouth and are used to hold and move prey, two tentacles which are used to quickly
        capture
        prey, and a radula which is used to tear and rip apart any prey they have captured.<sup>[5]</sup> Cuttlefish are
        well known for
        their unmatched camouflaging abilities which are possible due to light scattering leucophores, pigmented
        chromatophore
        organs, and structurally reflecting iridophores all located in their skin.<sup>[9]</sup> These specialized
        characteristics give
        them the ability to not only change their colour, but also change the texture appearance of their skin and all
        of this
        is done despite them being colour-blind. Their camouflaging abilities are categorized into four main types
        including
        mottle, stipple, uniform, and disruptive.<sup>[10]</sup> These complex camouflage abilities are not just present
        in adult
        cuttlefish, but cuttlefish juveniles also have these complicated characteristics, which allows them to be able
        to
        camouflage from a young age.<sup>[11]</sup></p>
    <h2>Reproduction</h2>
    <p><img src="image/cuttlefish.jpg" alt="Fish Image" class="cuttlefish">Cuttlefish reach sexual maturity between 14 and 18 months of
        age. During breeding season, which occurs during spring and
        summer in shallow waters, male cuttlefish will display a black and white zebra pattern on their mantle to
        attract
        females and females will display a uniform grey colour to indicate they are ready to mate. Cuttlefish are
        internal
        fertilizers and the number of fertilized eggs can range from 100 to 1000. After the eggs are fertilized, they
        will
        remain in the oviduct of the female for anywhere between 30 and 90 days before they are laid.<sup>[2]</sup> The
        eggs attach to
        seaweed, shells, or other substrates to prevent them from drifting away and have ink deposits on them to aid in
        camouflage.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
    <h2>Uses</h2>
    <p>epia officinalis is a species that is commonly fished in the Mediterranean, including countries like Greece and
        Spain.
        Although it is fished extensively and wild stocks in some regions are close to being over-exploited, population
        numbers
        are not declining so the species is of Least Concern on the list of threatened species.<sup>[1]</sup> Cuttlefish have many
        uses,
        which makes them a popular catch. Their cuttlebones are commonly sold in the pet bird industry because they
        provide a
        good source of calcium, help keep a bird's beak trimmed, improve jaw strength, and provide entertainment for the
        bird.<sup>[12]</sup> Sepia officinalis is also growing in popularity as a foodstuff because it has a similar taste to
        octopus and
        squid and is a good source of healthy proteins and lipids.<sup>[13]</sup> Cephalopod ink is believed to have many
        beneficial health
        effects including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activity, antimicrobial and potential anticancer
        properties, and
        anti-hypertensive and anti-retroviral activity.<sup>[14]</sup> Other uses for cephalopod ink include writing, drawing, and
        painting
        uses along with potential cosmetic uses. Similar to cuttlefish meat, the ink is also commonly used in the food
        industry
        for both its flavor and as a food dye.<sup>[14]</sup><img src="image/cuttlefish2.jpg" alt="use of fish"></p>
